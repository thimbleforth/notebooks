    "* Explicit\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Easy to rotate\n",

    "* Easy revocation and rotation of local certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimal blast radius if you make a mistake\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s the same mental model used in real PKI systems. It's just scaled down to a homelab where a busy person doesn't have all day to run an AD CA with all the gubbins.\n",
